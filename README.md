# Password-Generator

## Description

This project is a refactoring of a password generator. The purpose of the refactoring is to utilize JavaScript concepts in order to build a responsive randomized password generator. Users will be able to choose from a list of criteria including whether they'd like special characters or numbers in their password as well as upper or lower case letters. This ensures greater information security for users. I learned how to write functions, arrays, conditional statements and utilize operators in an effective and efficient manner.
